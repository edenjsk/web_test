        <p>Palladian <strong>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" title="wiki">
        architec­ture</a> 
        is <u>an archi­tec­tural style</u></strong> based on the work of Andrea Palladio. Buildings which adhere to his concepts of symmetry, perspective and the principles of classical architecture are described as Palladian. This can be seen at Villa La Rotonda (pictured), one of Palladio's most influential designs, which he began around 1565. The style spread from Italy in the early 17th century and was introduced to England by Inigo Jones.</p>

    <p>The early 18th century saw a resurgence led by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, whose own Chiswick House, and Holkham Hall with William Kent, are among the finest English Palladian buildings. In North America, Palladianism was taken up by Thomas Jefferson; his home, Monticello, was based on a design by Palladio. The style was superseded by Neoclassical architecture in the later 18th century, and in the 19th both were eclipsed by the Gothic Revival. Palladio remains an influential architect and works in his style continue to be built.</p>
